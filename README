Simple universal remote control.  I couldn't find any examples
online that included multiple buttons and both raw and encoded
codes, so I decided to toss this on the net in case someone else
wants to try making their own universal remote.  See Remote2.ino
for more details.

Note that if you're not using Visual Micro to work on arduino
projects in visual studio, you only need Remote2.ino and Codes.h.
There's a modified version of Ladyada's rawirdecode app in contrib
for convenience.
